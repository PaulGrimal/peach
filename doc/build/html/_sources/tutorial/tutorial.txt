This section is a tutorial on how to use the library. The tutorial shows how to
use the basic functions and classes to get something -- usually very simple --
done. The goal is not to show the power of the library (consult the Demos for
those), but to help learn to do things using computational intelligence.

Most of the source code to the tutorials can be found in a directory in your
Peach package. Search for the ``tutorials`` directory in the package you
download, the tutorials will be there. They are, usually, very well comented and
described, but if you may feel that they are not, please write to us. And if you
write a nice program that you think that could be in the tutorial page, write to
us too
